 What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL? We believe that
 no matter where you go, you should always be able to enjoy the
 simple pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable
 environment. At home, reading the morning paper. At your local
 SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in some
 foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like an old friend.
 After all, coffee is a ritual that transcends all cultural boundaries.
 It makes us feel alert, energetic and alive.
 
 <font size="+3" color="#006600">Where we began</font>
 Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in
 Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his
 grandfather Oluf’s adventures and expeditions. Often his
 grandfather would bring back exotic coffees for the family to enjoy.  
 Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked
 all kinds of odd jobs. He worked in Parisian cafes and Italian
 espresso bars. He worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea.
 And in a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting the perfect
 coffee bean and roasting it to perfection. He returned home in 1980 to
 open the first SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own
 unique blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly
 became the place to gather – day or night – not only in Stockholm,
 Sweden, but 670 cities around the world. 
 
 <font size="+3" color="#006600">What makes SCAAL the best coffee? </font>
 
 Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an
 apprentice in the coffee fields to every buyer,
 roaster, and  franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for
 coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB – strictly hard bean
 or strictly high grown – coffee beans. To ensure their flavorful
 oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are taken to protect
 the coffee bean from heat, light, air and moisture. 
 
 All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect
 cup of coffee.
 
 There are so many places you could go to buy coffee.We've
 gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that SCAAL is your best
 choice. The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL relies on
 selective picking, a labor-intensive process that involves
 making several passes among the trees for those cherries that are
 perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which stands for
 strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. Beans that are grown at
 a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above sea level for optimum flavor.
 Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are roasted
 on-site in small batches by a Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed 
 to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.
